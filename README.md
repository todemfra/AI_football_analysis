# ⚽ AI Football Analysis System

In this project, you'll learn how to use **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **deep learning** to build a powerful football (soccer) analysis system.

We utilize **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect players, referees, and footballs. Beyond detection, the system incorporates **object tracking**, **custom YOLO training**, and **camera motion analysis** using optical flow.

We also introduce **player team assignment** based on t-shirt color using KMeans clustering, and apply **perspective transformation** to measure player movement in real-world units (meters).

This project addresses several real-world challenges in sports analytics and is designed for both beginners and experienced machine learning practitioners.

## 🎥 What You'll Learn

1. ✅ Use **Ultralytics YOLOv8** to detect objects in images and videos.
2. 🧠 **Fine-tune and train** your own YOLO model on a custom dataset.
3. 🎨 Use **KMeans clustering** for pixel segmentation to identify t-shirt colors.
4. 📈 Apply **optical flow** to measure camera movement between frames.
5. 🗺️ Implement **OpenCV's perspective transformation** to model depth and scale.
6. 🏃‍♂️ Calculate **player speed and distance covered** on the field (in meters).
